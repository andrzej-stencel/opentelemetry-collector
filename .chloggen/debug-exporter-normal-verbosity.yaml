subtext: |
  The Debug exporter's behavior of `normal` verbosity used to be the same as for `basic` verbosity,
  which is to output only one line of text for each telemetry batch.
  This changes the behavior of `normal` verbosity to output one line of text
  for each telemetry item - log record, metric data point, or span.
  This is a good middle ground between `basic` (one line per telemetry batch)
  and `detailed` (multiple lines per telemetry item).
  This only applies to the Debug exporter;
  the deprecated Logging exporter keeps old behavior.

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
